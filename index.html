		<p>A16Z, a web3-native NFT order book protocol with no costs, is now available.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The NFT market is still immature and illiquid, despite the fact that it erupted in 2021. The majority of secondary trading occurs on a single exchange, orders are stored in centralized databases, and market making is dominated by a few bots making lowball offers.</p>
		<br>
		<p>This is due in part to the monolithic architecture of NFT markets, which tightly pair their front-ends, order books, and swap contracts, fragmenting liquidity and causing innovation bottlenecks.</p>
		<p>A16Z has been unbundled. To aggregate all liquidity into a single pool, this proposal employs an open, permissionless order book.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The modular design of the A16Z is a new primitive that opens up a world of possibilities: shared pool.</p>
		<br>
		<p>From community-owned markets to presumer portfolio managers, a slew of new uses might arise, all without fragmenting liquidity.</li>
		<p>Tools can focus on a certain market sector, such as wallets with built-in sell capabilities or a rarity explorer that focuses on the buying experience.</li>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>By flowing into all of the marketplaces and interfaces through the common order book, novel new kinds of liquidity (AMMs, collection-wide offers, and so on) may quickly gain traction.</li>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>Without bothering about API keys or rate limitations, anybody may offer liquidity, making it more accessible to both professional market makers and regular collectors.</li>
			<br>
			<br>
		<p>A16Z isn't just another online store. It's a new layer in the stack that's meant to work with the levels above and below it. WAGMI.</p>
		<br>
		<p>A16Z aspires to unleash a flood of innovation at all layers of the stack by fully adopting the web3 concepts of open data and interoperability, providing considerably enhanced liquidity to NFTs.</p>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Architecture</h1>
		<br>
		<p>You normally have two options when designing an order book: optimize for cost (store orders off-chain) or optimize
			for openness (store orders on-chain). Because it's just too expensive to hold orders on-chain on Ethereum, where 80%
			of NFT is transacted, off-chain order books have dominated (OpenSea, Rarible..). Surprisingly, the more secure a
			chain is, the more off-chain storage it encourages.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<p>A16z adds a third option. Orders are stored on-chain, but on a distinct chain than the rest of the data. Orders do
				not require the whole strength of Ethereum to secure them because they are self-contained signed messages. Instead,
				A16Z uses Arweave to store orders as a low-cost &quot;Data Lake.&quot; It's inexpensive enough that markets can
				continue to provide the free listing experience that customers demand, while still being secure enough to ensure
				data availability without permission.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>Arweave's five-minute block times would normally be too sluggish for a busy order book, but here's the cool part: we
				don't have to wait for blocks to be confirmed. The Indexer can ingest the orders as soon as they enter the mempool
				because they are targeted to a different chain, making the a16z Order Book real-time, highly accessible, and
				globally consistent..</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h1>A16Z Data Lake</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Built on top of Arweave, the A16Z Data Lake is an open and permissionless data repository. Designed to put off-chain
				liquidity onto the blockchain so that it can be leveraged by everyone. This is essential for creating modular
				protocols and apps that aren't reliant on a single central gatekeeper.
				<br>
			<br>
			
			A16Z Data Lake, like data lakes used in analytics, is focused on storing raw order data without really validating if it
				is
				genuine. Partly to keep costs low, and partly because validating tokens requires knowledge of the parent
				blockchain's
				state in order to determine who owns particular tokens. An Indexer node, which can recreate the state of the Order
				Book
				from the raw data on each chain, performs this validation at a higher level.</p>
